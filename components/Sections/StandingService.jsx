              Open heart surgery needs more than a surgeon. It needs theatres equipped for cardiopulmonary bypass, an intensive care unit that can manage a patient through the first critical days, and a hospital around it — imaging, laboratory, pharmacy, blood supply and nursing.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Gracespring Hospitals provides that platform, and the cardiac team is permanently based there: surgeons, anaesthetists, perfusionists, intensivists, nurses and allied staff who work together case after case.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Because the team stays, the programme is not limited to a surgical window. Patients are operated on when they are ready, and reviewed by the same clinicians long afterwards.
